# RuleBasedEngine

Demonstration code for a simple rule-based enginde done in Java which was created to showcase the concept of using multiple design-patterns as explained in [this stackoverflow posting](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20763189/creating-a-simple-rule-engine-in-java/20892587#20892587) to evaluate the content of a provided string.

The rule-base engine does not yet respect binding-order strength nor include braces or proper exception-handling. An explanation on how to solve this was given in [this post here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/30718910/how-to-dynamically-add-brackets-to-a-boolean-expression/30719548#30719548)
